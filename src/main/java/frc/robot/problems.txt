1. Jittering while driving without turning(Prabhu- Confused about navx issues)
2. Motor rod to move arm is bent at full extension. 
(Need to have limit switches before it bends the rod)
3. Arm is off center (Mechanical- considered normal because it doesn't cause any 
major issues.)
4. Arm didn't go fully down after full extension (ArmSubsystem- Sahil)
5. Sahil is wrong, the back limit switch CANNOT be hit when the arm goes all 
the way back.(Mechanical/Software Sahil)
6. Without soft limit switches. Max limit value = 105.5 ish Min limit switch = +0.5
